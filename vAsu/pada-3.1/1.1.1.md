vRtti: आ पञ्चमाध्यायपरिसमाप्तेर्यानित ऊर्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्यामः प्रत्ययसंज्ञास्ते वेदितव्याः, प्रकृत्युपपदोपाधिविकारागमान्वर्जयित्वा ॥

This is an aphorism intended solely to regulate the sense of others. From this place forward up to the end of the Fifth Book, whatsoever we shall treat of, will get the name of 'Pratyaya' or an affix, except the 'prakriti' or base (such as गुप्, तिम्, कित् in III.
