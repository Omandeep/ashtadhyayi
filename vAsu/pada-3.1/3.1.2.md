This is also an 'adhikara' or regulating sutra, and is understood in all subsequent aphorisms; or it might also be called a 'paribhasha' or interpreting aphorism. That which is called an affix comes after, or is placed after, the 'dhatu' or root, or the 'pratipadika' or crude form; as कर्तव्यम् and तैतिरीयम्.
