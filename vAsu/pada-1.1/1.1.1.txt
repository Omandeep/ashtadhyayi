1. PT, and are called vriddhi. This defines the word vriddhi. The letters IT, and t are vriddhi letters. The sutra consists of three words vșiddhi, at and aich. means the long T, the final a being indicatory only, and is for the sake of 
the pratyâhâra aich, and the pratyâhâra er means the letters and wit. 
The indicatory a in vrą serves the purpose of showing that the very form of having two måtrâs or prosodial measure, is to be taken. This also joins with the succeeding vowels è and wit by the rule of a4T (I. 1.70) or that "which precedes or succeeds ą," and indicates that these vowels must be taken as having two mâtrâs only, though they may be the result of the combination of vowels whose aggregate mâtrâs may be more than two. A short vowel has one måtrâ, a long vowel has two, and a consonant has half a mátrâ. Thus by a rule of arm or euphonic conjunction of letters #+T=T, as #FI + ST*:= HETETE. Here T has two mâtrâs and not four. So also in 35: the vowel e the resultant of tê has only two, not four, mâtrâs. 
Thus the initial vowels in the following secondary derivative nouns are vriddhi forms of their primitive vowels. yy: "bodily", from t ; 'body' graag : "optional", from "option"; 7 9:"the son of Upagu", from the word 49: meaning "a sage called Upagu." Similarly in grofter: "belonging to the house" the wis radical, and is also called vriddhi. The word vriddhi occurs in sûtras like farg9TTI (VII. 2. 1.) “Let the final ro of the base get vriddhi substitute before the affix ft of the Parasmaipada".
